Most people are familiar, but a microwave is for heating up food. That is my goal whenever I am going up to this technology to use it. 
- Effectiveness. This piece of technology heats up my food in a moderately quick manner and is effective at its job
- Efficient. It is efficient enough that I don't have any complaints. 
- Safe. I have never had an issue with myself being in danger or of breaking the product
- Satisfying. It heats my food up when I need heated food, so I am satisfied with it.
- Learnable. It was slightly different in terms of how to set time that other microwaves I had used before, but it was easily figured out.
- Memorable. Doesn't need to be too memorable.
- Useful. I do like warm food.
- Error tolerant. It is easy to restart if something is wrong.

I walk up to my freezer, stomach rumbling. I look inside and see that I have a couple of hot pockets. I decide to grab one of them. I look up towards the microwave and remove the packaging from the hot pocket. I pull the handle to open the door to the microwave and put the hot pocket on a paper towel inside of the microwave. How to set the timer is slightly different than the just hitting the number buttons that does the trick on other microwaves I have used before. It takes a bit of hitting all of the numerical buttons before **learn** and I try hitting the time button. It then allows me to start selecting the time I want. I set the timer and wait as the microwave **efficiently** warms up my food for my hungry belly, making the microwave the only **useful** piece of technology I care about righy now. It beeps that it is done and then continues to spin with the lights on for another three seconds after that, which is weird. But it doesn't matter as my hot pocket is looking scrumcious and I am about to be **satisfied**. However, when I bite into the hot pocket I end up burning my mouth. It seems that the error **tolerance** of being able to reset the user interface doesn't stop me from over cooking my food.
