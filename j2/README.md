This piece of technology is a percussion massage gun. It is made to help massage muscles in both soft and aggressive ways. It is used by putting one of the heads, able to be seen in the top picture, into the percussion gun and turning it on. The way to use this machine is to go to the bottom of the handle and flick the switch to on, and then hit the middle button on the back. You can then adjust the speed of the oscillation with the two buttons, one which has a plus and one which has a minus. To stop, one must only hit the middle button again. Alternatively, the massage gun will turn off if no button has been hit within ten minutes. With only 4 buttons the item is easily **learnable**, especially since all four give some type of visual feedback. The only thing that is slightly unintuitive is that the heads are pressed in, there is no other mechanic like twisting necessary, and it can potentially throw you off for a second if you don't think that the head will stay in just by pushing it in the front slot. With four buttons and minimal settings, the percussion gun is very **error tolerant**. I find it to be both **useful** and **satisfying** as I have a tight back and it helps loosen my muscles as well as the fact that it feels good while using it. One thing customers may have to be careful of is the fact that there is nothing stopping them from using the product too forcefully and causing some pain or even injury, which means that this product isn't totally **safe**.

## User Experience
You come home after a long day at the office and have been sitting down all day. You weren't able to go do your usual exercise and your body is feeling quite stiff. You go and grab the percussion gun and get your own private massage to loosen up all of the muscles that have been tightening up over the day of little to no movement. You let out a sigh of relief as the vibrations bring pleasure to your monkey brain for some unknown reason. You keep using it until the battery runs out and as it turns off you are left with the slight tingling sensation that follows after any extended use. You are happy that the buttons on the machine weren't more confusing which would keep you from feeling good for longer.
